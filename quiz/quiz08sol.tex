\item The revenue from selling $q$ items is $R(q) = 500q - q^2$, and
  the total cost is $C(q) = 10000 + 3q^2$. At what quantity is profit
  maximized?

  \vfill
  {\color{blue}

    We know that $\pi(q) = R(q) - C(q)$, so
    \[
    \pi(q) = 500q - q^2 - (10000 + 3q^2) = -4q^2 + 500q - 10000.
    \]
    Then $\pi'(q) = -8q + 500$, so $\pi(q)$ has a critical point at $q
    = 62.5$. We know this critical point is a global maximum since
    $\pi(q)$ is a parabola with a negative leading coefficient. Then
    producing $62.5$ items will maximize out profit.

\item[2.] If you have 100 meters of fencing and want to enclose a
  rectangular area up against a long, straight wall, what dimensions
  maximize the area you can enclose?

  \vfill
  {\color{blue}

    We know that the area of a rectangular fence of length $\ell$ and
    width $w$ is given by
    \[
    A = \ell w.
    \]
    If the lengh of the fence is against the wall, we know that the
    total amount of fencing is given by $2w + \ell$. Since we have 100
    feet of fencing, we obtain
    \[
    100 = 2w + \ell,
    \]
    so $\ell = 100 - 2w$. Then we have
    \[
    A = (100-2w)w = 100w - 2w^2.
    \]
    Taking the derivative we see that $\frac{dA}{dw} = 100 - 4w$, so
    we have a critical point at $w = 25$. We know this critical point
    is a global maximum since $A$ is a parabola with a negative
    leading coefficient. Then a fence with a width of 25 feet and a
    length of 50 feet will maximize the area we can enclose.
