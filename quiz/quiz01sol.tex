\item Find the equation of a line that passes through the $(x, y)$
  points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 8)$.

  {\color{blue}
    We know that the line must be of the form $y= mx + b$.  Then
    \[
    m = \text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{8 - 2}{3
      - 1} = 3.
    \]
    We can find $b$ by plugging in a point
    \begin{align*}
      y & = 3x + b\\
      2 & = 3\cdot 1 + b\\
      b & = -1.
    \end{align*}
    Then the equation for the line is
    \[
    y = 3x - 1.
    \]

\item[2.] A town has a population of 2000 people at time $t = 0$.  In
  each of the following cases, write a formula for the population $P$,
  of the town as a function of the year $t$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] The population increases by $50$ people per year.
    \vfill
    {\color{blue}

      Since the population is growing by the same absolute amount per
      year the population is growing linearly.  Then
      \[
      P = 50t + 2000.
      \]

    }
    \vfill
  \item[(b)] The population increases by 3\% a year.
    \vfill
    {\color{blue}

      Since the population is growing by the same relative amount per
      year the population is growing exponentially.  Then
      \[
      P = 2000(1.03)^t.
      \]
