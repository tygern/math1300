\begin{enumerate}
\item A cylindrical tank, 3 meters in diameter and 6m tall, is being
  filled with water.  The depth of the water in the tank is increasing
  at a rate of $0.5$ meters per hour.  How fast is the volume of the
  water in the tank increasing?

  \newpage

\item A spherical snowball is melting. Its radius is decreasing at 0.2
  cm per hour when the radius is 15cm. How fast is its volume
  decreasing at that time? (The volume $V$ of a sphere of radius $r$ is given by $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$)

  \newpage

\item Two people on bikes start riding from the same position.  Person
  A starts riding north at a rate of 20 miles per hour Person B starts
  riding east at 25 miles per hour.  At what rate is the distance
  separating the two people changing after 3 hours?

\item A lighthouse is 1 km offshore, and rotates clockwise once every
  minute.  When the angle $\theta=\dfrac{\pi}{6}$ (see diagram below),
  how fast is the beam of light moving along the shoreline in
  kilometers per hour?
