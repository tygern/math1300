\item Let $g(v)$ be the fuel efficiency, in miles per gallon, of a car
  traveling at a velocity of $v$ miles per hour. Answer the following
  questions using complete sentences.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What are the units of $g(60)$?

    \vfill
    
  \item What is the practical meaning of the statement $g(60) = 30$?

    \vfill
    
  \item What are the units of $g'(60)$?

    \vfill
    
  \item What is the practical meaning of the statement $g'(60) = -1.2$?

\item A company's revenue from car sales, $C$ (in thousands of
  dollars), is a function of advertising expenditure, $a$ (in
  thousands of dollars), so $C = f(a)$. Answer the following questions
  using complete sentences.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What does the company hope is true about the sign of $f'(a)$?

    \vfill
    
  \item What does the statement $f'(100) = 2$ mean in practical terms?
    How about $f'(100) = 0.5$?

    \vfill
    
  \item Suppose the company plans to spend about \$100,000 on
    advertising. If $f'(100)=2$, should the company spend more or less
    than \$100,000 on advertising? What if $f'(100) = 0.5$?
